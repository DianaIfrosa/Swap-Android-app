# Swap (Android app for Bachelor's Thesis)
This repository contains my bachelor's thesis for the Computer Science Bachelor's degree that I followed at University of Bucharest.

## Abstract
&nbsp; The “Swap” mobile application comes to the aid of people who want to refresh their home, either by donating the objects they no longer use, or by exchanging them for others. In this way, they contribute to a less polluted environment and at the same time they take part of a community oriented towards helping others.  
&nbsp; Through “Swap”, users can post unnecessary objects, see other people's objects, and when they wish to make an exchange, they can propose it to other users through the chat built within the application; this process also applies to donations and the chat can also be used to request more information. In addition, the application provides a dedicated page where they can save their favorite posts, a real-time map where they can more easily see what objects are available around them, but also a History section where their exchanges/donations from the past are saved, as well as their own still available items.  
&nbsp; Moreover, they have access to a special page, personalized for each individual user, intended for recommendations, where they can view items based on the preferences previously saved in the settings, that respect some constraints (can be picked up from certain favorite cities, are posted by owners whose objects attract them, contain certain keywords or fall under specific categories).  
&nbsp; Since the idea is materialized in a mobile application for Android, a wide group of users is targeted, given the fact that it is a widespread operating system, and by this fact the initiative to recycle and reuse already existing objects is easily transmitted to the majority of smartphone users.
